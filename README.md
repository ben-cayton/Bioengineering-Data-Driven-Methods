# Bioengineering-Data-Driven-Methods
Machine learning projects in Bioengineering 

These projects were completed as part of the 
Bioengineering course, "BE 481: Data-Driven Methods in Bioengineering", 
at Washington State University, Pullman, during the Spring 2021 semester. 

The three machine learning projects included are:

1) Classifying image modality (PET or CT images),

2) Classifying ECG signals (normal or abnormal)

3) Classifying tumors from breast ultrasound images
(no tumor, benign tumor, or malignant tumor) 

The projects all use supervised learning methods (labeled data). The first two projects use learning models from SKLearn. The first two projects extract features from the processed dataset into a feature array and pass the feature array into the learning model. Project 3 uses AlexNet's neural netwrok model. The neural network requires the dataset to be processed but does not require a feature array to be created because neural networks compute their own feature maps. Projects 1 and 3 use datasets of image files which could be of any image filetype (with some code revision), while project 2 uses a dataset of bio-signals which were originally MATLAB files but could be csv files (with some code revision).  

These projects provide an introduction to supervised machine learning methods in Bioengineering topics.
