# Bioengineering-Data-Driven-Methods
Machine learning projects in Bioengineering 

These projects were completed as part of the 
Bioengineering 481 course, "Data-Driven Methods in Bioengineering", 
at Washington State University, Pullman, during the Spring 2021 semester. 

The three machine learning projects included are:

1) Classifying image modality  (PET or CT images),

2) Classifying ECG signals (normal or abnormal)

3) Classifying tumors from breast ultrasound
